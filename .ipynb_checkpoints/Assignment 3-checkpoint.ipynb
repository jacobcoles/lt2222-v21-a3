    "# LT2222 V21 Assignment 3 -- Predict Swedish Vowels\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The written Swedish language has the following inventory of lowercase vowels characters: a, e, i, o, u, y, å¸ ä, ö, é.  The Evil Vowel Fairy is threatening to magically steal the vowels from Swedish texts, replacing them with blank symbols.  Before the Fairy does that, your mission is to create a system that automatically puts the vowels back, rendering the evil plan fruitless.  The most important text that the Evil Vowel Fairy is targeting are a group of newspaper articles written in the 19th century currently hosted by Språkbanken, because the Evil Vowel Fairy has some deranged plan involving the 19th century.\n",
    "\n",
    "(These newspaper articles have a bunch of other, now-archaic or foreign vowels that the Fairy is not interested in and you will ignore.)\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a secret agent who has helped by writing some scripts to train a vowel prediction model, but that agent has written the scripts a little cryptically to make it hard for the Fairy, who doesn't really understand computers but it never hurts to make sure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every part of this assignment that involves Python scripting needs to be done on the bash command line on mltgpu or eduserv.  Include your name in README.md.\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is due Monday, March 29, 2021 at 9:00.  There are 31 points on this assignment, plus opportunity for 22 bonus points.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "Fork and clone the GitHub repository: https://github.com/asayeed/lt2222-v21-a3 (Links to an external site.)\n",
    "\n",
    "There will be three files, train.py, model.py, and README.md.  You will write your responses to whatever needs text responses plus other comments and instructions in README.md.\n",
    "\n",
    "The texts are available at\n",
